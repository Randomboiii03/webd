# Security Recommendations for WEBD Website

## DDoS Protection

1. **Use a CDN with DDoS protection**
   - Cloudflare offers free DDoS protection
   - Vercel Enterprise includes DDoS protection
   - AWS Shield or Cloudfront can be used for AWS deployments

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - The middleware.ts file implements basic rate limiting
   - For production, use a more robust solution like Redis for rate limiting

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement proper caching headers for static assets
   - Use CDN caching for frequently accessed content

## Security Headers

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Implemented in next.config.mjs
   - Restricts which resources can be loaded
   - Prevents XSS attacks

2. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**
   - Forces HTTPS connections
   - Prevents downgrade attacks

3. **X-Content-Type-Options**
   - Prevents MIME type sniffing

4. **X-Frame-Options**
   - Prevents clickjacking attacks

5. **Referrer-Policy**
   - Controls how much referrer information is included with requests

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for security testing
   - Implement regular penetration testing

2. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update npm packages to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities

3. **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
   - Cloudflare WAF
   - AWS WAF
   - ModSecurity

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Set up monitoring for unusual traffic patterns
   - Configure alerts for security events

5. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular backups of website content and database
   - Test restoration procedures

6. **Error Handling**
   - Custom error pages that don't reveal system information
   - Proper logging of errors without exposing sensitive data

7. **API Security**
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Rate limit API endpoints
   - Validate all input data

8. **Consider Serverless Architecture**
   - Serverless functions scale automatically during traffic spikes
   - Helps mitigate some DDoS attacks by design
